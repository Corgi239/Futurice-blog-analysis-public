# Futurice blog analysis

## Summary of the project 

As a means of bolstering sales, marketing, and talent acquisition efforts, the Finnish consulting company Futurice frequently publishes blogs created by the company's employees. Blogs serve as one of the company's public outreach channels and thus constitute an integral part of Futurice's brand, as well as play a pivotal role in attracting targeted clients and talent, establishing and maintaining business relationships with customers and other companies. However, writing timely, engaging blogs is challenging, even with the help of existing practices, such as search engine optimization. In this project we analyzed past blogs from Futurice to provide an overview of their history and context and to leverage gathered information for a simple recommendation system. 

As an output of the project, we have constructed an [interactive web page](https://corgi239-futurice-blog-analysis-public-srcguihome-t16z9r.streamlit.app/) that showcases results obtained from the conducted analysis, offers an online blog editing assistant, and houses a rich visualization tool where users can explore relevant statistics about past blogs.

A more comprehensive report can be found in `reports/pdf/Project_Report.pdf`.

## Confidential data

Some of the data used for this project was provided directly by Futurice under a confidentiality agreement. For the public version of the project, all occurrences of said data were replaced with randomly generated noise, and all conclusions derived from it were redacted from the report and the presentations slides.
